# iPhone-Application-Hacking-Tutorial
This is a tutorial I made way back in the day (2013) for iPhone application hacking, originally published on www.iapphacks.com, a forum that is now dead. However it is out of date, 80% of it is still very relevant and useful.

The tutorial is all in PDF format, so check out the link on the github page for a download (https://github.com/GrantEaton/ios-app-hacking) 

Or, alternatively, download the tutorial in PDF format from http://www.mediafire.com/download/0pw3832tv29skb1/Hacking+Tutorial+for+Apps.pdf
