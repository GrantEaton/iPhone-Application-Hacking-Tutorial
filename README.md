# iPhone-Application-Hacking-Tutorial
This is a tutorial I made way back in the day (2013) for iPhone application hacking. However it is out of date, 80% of it is still very relevant and useful.

The tutorial is all in PDF format, so check out the link on the github page for a download (https://github.com/GrantEaton/iPhone-Application-Hacking-Tutorial)
